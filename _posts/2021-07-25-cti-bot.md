## Initial Idea

I often struggle while reading through long threat intelligence reports, or when I try to remember which sources I would want to read today in order not to miss anything.

That is why I decided to somehow automate my efforts, and receive short summaries at least once per day (in the morning), so that I know whether the article is worth reading or not.

## Why Telegram

I use it to subscribe to different communities, which happened to be present only there, plus it has some handy features and quite simple bot API.

## Workflow

What I came up with is using RSS feeds to pull news from different relevant sources, such as Talos Intelligence, Intezer, Security Affairs, international CERTs, and a few others.

Those intelligence providers update their feeds as often as once per day, or once per week, depending on the category of the articles, so I decided it would be enough to check for the updates from them once per day, pulling those from the last 24 hours.

## Development

Main loop of the bot is written in this function:

{% highlight python %}
def main():
    updater = Updater(token)
    dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

    dispatcher.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start_command))
    dispatcher.add_handler(CommandHandler("help", help_command))

    j = updater.job_queue
    j.run_daily(morning, days=(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), time=datetime.time(hour=9, minute=30, second=00, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('Europe/Kiev')))

    updater.start_polling()
    updater.idle()
{% endhighlight %}

Method which runs "morning" routine runs every day at 09:30 AM in my local timezone.

The logic of pulling latest news is written here:

{% highlight python %}
def read_feed(link, tags=True, summary=True, published=True, updated=False):
    feed = feedparser.parse(link)
    events = set()
    to_time = datetime.datetime.timestamp(datetime.datetime.now())
    from_time = to_time - 86400
    for event in feed.entries:
        if updated:
            event["time"] = event["updated"]
        elif published:
            event["time"] = event["published"]
        event_time = datetime.datetime.timestamp(dateutil.parser.parse(event["time"], tzinfos={"PDT": gettz("America/Los_Angeles")}))
        if from_time < event_time < to_time:
            events.add(event)
            if tags:
                event["tags"] = format_tags(event["tags"])
            else:
                event["tags"] = None
        return events
    else:
        return None
{% endhighlight %}

Creation of the single post happens here:

{% highlight python %}
def create_post(events):
    if not events:
        return None
    today_date = datetime.datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    text = "<b>" + today_date + "</b>\n\n"
    for event in events:
        if event["title"] not in text:
            text += event["title"] + ' | <a href="{0}">{1}</a>'.format(event["link"], event["org"])
            text += "\n\n"
    return text
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly, here is how the main workflow executes

{% highlight python %}
def workflow():
    feeds = fetch_feed_metadata('feeds.csv')
    posts = fetch_from_feeds(feeds)
    post = create_post(posts)
    return post
{% endhighlight %}

And here is how a sample post looks like:
